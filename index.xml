      <description>After spending a whole eight years of my career without a website, I decided enough is enough and started putting some research in to what kind of website I want to build. There are many options out there and I finally settled on something that will help me work quickly but also at a very low cost.
It struck me fairly fast that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend a huge amount of time on things like site security, fees, maintenance.</description>
